h1 Who are we?

	|We are a group of amateur, professional, student, and hobbyist biologists who aim to revolutionize the way biological science is used in society.
	|In the near term, we are setting up a wetlab space. We have growing list of projects we are interested in persuing, which can be found on our Trello Projects Page.
	|In the long-term, we aim to provide a space where anybody with an idea about biology can safely come and test it out.
